Curve Number Generator

Algorithm description

This algorithm generates Curve Number layer for the given Area of Interest within the contiguous United States. It can also download Soil, Land Cover, and Impervious Surface datasets for the same area.

Input parameters

Area Boundary
Area of Interest

CN_Lookup.csv
Optional Table to relate NLCD Land Use Value and HSG Value to a particular curve number. By default the algorithm uses pre defined table. The table must have two columns 'GDCode' and 'CN_Join'.

Drained Soils? [leave unchecked if not sure]
Certain Soils are categorized as dual category in SSURGO dataset. They have Hydrologic Soil Group D for Undrained Conditions and Hydrologic Soil Group A/B/C for Drained Conditions. If left unchecked the algorithm will assume HSG D for all dual category soils.  If checked the algorithm will assume HSG A/B/C for each dual category soil.
