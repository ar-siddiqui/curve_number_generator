# Curve-Number-Generator
QGIS Plugin to generate Curve Number layer for any Area of Interest within the contiguous United States. It can also download Soil, Land Cover, and Impervious Surface datasets for the same area.

## Installation
Curve Number Generator Plugin can be downloaded from from official QGIS plugin repository (see the demo below) or from https://github.com/ar-siddiqui/curve_number_generator/releases

## Algorithm Description
This algorithm gets land use data from NLCD web server and soil data from SSURGO database and intersects these datasets to create a combined land use & soil layer. This layer is then joined to a lookup table that provides unique relationship between land use, soil and Curve Number. The final output is a Curve Number layer for the area of interest. 

## Input Parameters

- Area Boundary:  
    Area of Interest

- CN_Lookup.csv:  
    Optional Table to relate NLCD Land Use Value and HSG Value to a particular curve number. By default the algorithm uses pre defined table. The table must have two columns 'GDCode' and 'CN_Join'.

- Drained Soils? [leave unchecked if not sure]:  
    Certain Soils are categorized as dual category in SSURGO dataset. They have Hydrologic Soil Group D for Undrained Conditions and Hydrologic Soil Group A/B/C for Drained Conditions. If left unchecked the algorithm will assume HSG D for all dual category soils.  If checked the algorithm will assume HSG A/B/C for each dual category soil.

## Outputs

- NLCD Land Cover Vector:  
    NLCD 2019 Land Cover Dataset Vectorized

- NLCD Land Cover Raster:  
    NLCD 2019 Land Cover Dataset

- NLCD Impervious Surface Raster:  
    NLCD 2019 Impervious Surface Dataset

- Soil Layer:  
    SSURGO Extended Soil Dataset 

- Curve Number Layer:  
    Generated Curve Number Layer based on Land Cover and HSG values.
